    WOW. YOU ARE QUITE SMASHING INDEED! WELL DONE!
    - â€“ - â€“ - â€“ - â€“ - â€“ - â€“ - â€“ - â€“ - â€“ - â€“ - â€“ -

    You really are on fire today! You passed the
    last level! There are many reasons to want to
    go to circus, but our character has a special
    reason for it.

    There are many parts in the image pointing to
    the circus, but literally every single page on
    the new Smashing Magazine points to it, too!
    Why does the character have a red scarf actually?
    Well, remember the book "Night Circus" by Erin
    Morgenstern? ;-)

    The Circus Tent is the Emoji-alike icon we are
    using for Membership. With the book referencing
    "IT" and clowns, the acceptable answers are ðŸ¤¡
    and ðŸŽª.

    - â€“ - â€“ - â€“ - â€“ - â€“ - â€“ - â€“ - â€“ - â€“ - â€“ - â€“ -
    Now, what are you waiting for? Collect all the
    emoji that you've found and tweet them at
    @smashingmag â€” you should be proud of yourself! ;-)

    Ah, still want to play? Well, try to find all 
    68 cats scattered all over the site. That will
    bring you a special reward. Ready? Go!

    And thanks for playing!
    Vitaly and the Smashing Team
